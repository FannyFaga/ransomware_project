# ransomware_project

Important note — read this first
- This repository contains material related to ransomware research. The content is intended only for research, education, and defensive purposes.
- Do not use anything in this repository to harm people, break laws, or access systems without explicit permission.
- If you are not sure whether your use is legal and ethical, stop and ask for clarification. The project authors are not responsible for misuse.

Simple description
This project collects code, examples, and notes related to ransomware research. It is written for people who want to study how ransomware works in order to defend systems, build detection tools, or learn secure coding practices.

Who this is for
- Security researchers and students learning about malware analysis and defenses.
- Developers and defenders who want to improve detection and incident response.
- Educators creating safe labs about ransomware behavior and recovery.

What you will find (high level)
- Source code files (for study only) — look, do not run on your normal machine.
- Documentation and notes that explain concepts and research findings.
- Tests and analysis scripts that may help study behavior without running dangerous code.
- Example files used for testing in a safe, isolated environment.

Safety and how to explore this repository safely
- Do NOT run any code from this repository on your daily machine or on any system with real data.
- Use an isolated, offline virtual machine (VM) or sandbox environment when you need to execute or instrument code.
- Prefer static analysis first: read the code, use linters, and run non-executing analysis tools.
- If you must run experiments, snapshot the VM, disconnect network access, and use disposable test data.
- If you are unfamiliar with safe malware analysis practices, consult experienced researchers or resources before proceeding.

Recommended safe tools and steps (high level)
- Inspect code with a text editor and static-analysis tools (linters, code scanners).
- Use sandboxing / VM platforms (VirtualBox, VMware, or official cloud sandboxes) with no network access.
- Use monitoring tools (process, file system, and network monitors) inside the sandbox.
- Keep backups of any data and never use production machines for experiments.

What this project is NOT
- This is not an instruction manual for creating real ransomware.
- This is not a tool for illegal activity.
- This is not a replacement for official incident response guidance.

How to contribute
- Open issues to report bugs or suggest improvements to the documentation.
- Submit pull requests with clear explanations; avoid adding runnable malicious samples unless they are clearly labeled for safe analysis and come with instructions for safe handling.
- Follow the code of conduct and be respectful in discussions.

Reporting problems or security concerns
- If you find sensitive information, accidental data exposure, or a real security issue, please contact the repository owner directly or use the repository's security contact method.
- Do not publicly post proof-of-concept exploits that enable immediate misuse.

- For questions about the project or safe usage, open an issue or contact the repository owner: FannyFaga.
